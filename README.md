<h1 align='center'>Theme Changer</h1>

## About
In computing, a theme is a preset package containing graphical appearance and functionality details. A theme usually comprises a set of shapes and colors 
for the graphical control elements, the window decoration and the window. 

> _I have created this website for learning **How to load CSS files using JavaScript**._

## Feature
In this website,
3 Buttons on the top right corner for changing the theme i.e., `Cobra Theme`, `Python Theme` and `None`.

When you click on the _Cobra Theme_ button the font size of the website will changes to **24px** and background color changes to **lightgreen**. And when 
you click on the _Python theme_ button then the font size of the website will changes to **18px** and background color changes to **skyblue**. While on 
clicking **None** then the website will come back to normal theme.
